# RollerSplat

This project was a test I did to apply for a job on Unity3D. It is a clone of the hyper casual game Roller Splat by Voodoo.

The goal of this project is to show a well designed architecture using Dependency Injection, event-based programming and interfaces, allowing unit testing etc...
